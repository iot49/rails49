 * The whole idea in three sentences. Whiten the cross-power spectrum of two
 * blocks and its inverse transform is a delta at the lag between them — so the
 * *phase* carries the shift and the discarded magnitude carries the lighting,
 * which is why a room whose lamps changed scores zero here and broke both pixel
 * baselines in the benchmark (#91, #92). Do it per block rather than per frame,
 * and the statistic separates the two things that move: a displaced **camera**
 * shifts every block coherently, a displaced **car** shifts only the blocks it
 * occupies, so the median over blocks reads the camera and ignores the traffic.
 * Take the minimum over references, because agreeing with any archive image is
 * agreement.
 *
 * Everything here is internal — `driftCheck.ts` is the only caller, and the
 * package's interface is `createDriftCheck`.
