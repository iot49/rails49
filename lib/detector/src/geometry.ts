 * (`boxCorners`). They are the same rectangle construction run in opposite
 * directions, so they share one internal core — a chord plus a half-width
 * normal — and one winding rule.
 *
 * This lives in the detector package rather than in `dataset` because both
 * consumers of the width constant are on this side of the line: L1 replaces a
 * predicted width with `carWidthPx`, and the UI's archive diagnostics draw
 * ground truth beside detections in the same frame. Leaving it in `dataset`
 * would put the constant that biases boxes toward `occupied` in two packages
 * with nothing checking that they agree — and `dataset/src/obb.ts` imports
 * `node:crypto` at module top, so the browser could not have reached it.
