/**
 * L1: per-sensor occupancy, as a pure function of L0.
 *
 * Never calls a second model, so it cannot contradict the boxes drawn beside
 * it, needs no second inference, and costs the same whether a layout has three
 * sensors or three hundred — the detector runs once per frame regardless.
 *
 * **Total**: one entry per sensor, always. `detections` and `dpt` are nullable
 * because three of SPEC's `unknown` causes are conditions of the *system*, not
 * of the geometry, and folding them in here is what stops the live view and the
 * diagnostics view from each building unknown-maps in their own branches —
 * three places that would have to agree about a contract SPEC wrote once.
 *
 * The box tested is **width-normalized**: centre, orientation and length come
 * from the detector, but `carWidthPx(dpt)` replaces the predicted width. Width
 * is a fit to a constant, so its deviation is pure error and directional: at
 * DPT 20 a car is ~42 px wide, so a centreline sensor sits ~21 px inside the
 * boundary, and an under-predicted 25 px width cuts that to ~12 px and can flip
 * a covered sensor to `clear`. Substituting the constant only ever widens an
 * under-predicted box, which is the safe direction. L0 still reports the raw
 * box — and the `Detection` returned on `occupied` is the raw one.
 *
 * @param input.detections L0 for this frame, or `null` when no model is loaded.
 * @param input.sensors    The layout's sensors, in `frame` coordinates.
 * @param input.dpt        Resolution in dots per track, or `null` when the
 *                         layout is uncalibrated.
 * @param input.frame      The frame sensors and detections are expressed in —
 *                         `camera.resolution`, normally.
 * @param input.drifted    Whether the camera has moved away from the pose the
 *                         archive was authored against (`@occupancy/drift`
 *                         against `layout.max_drift_px`). Optional, defaulting
 *                         to `false`, because a caller with no drift check
 *                         running is not asserting that the camera is steady —
 *                         it is saying it does not know, and that was every
 *                         caller before #94.
