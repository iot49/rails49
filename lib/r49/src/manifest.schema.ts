 * Resolution in Dots Per Track (DPT): a least-squares scale fit over the

 *
 * ```
 * pairs = { (i,j) : z_i == z_j,  i < j }
 * d_px' = d_px · (h − z)/h                      // camera height known
 * s     = Σ(d_px' · d_mm) / Σ(d_mm²)   over pairs
 * DPT   = s · gauge_mm(scale) · h/(h − z_ref)
 * ```
 *
 * **Why a height at all.** Layouts are not planar and cameras are not at
 * infinity, so under a pinhole camera at height `h` every length at height `z`
 * images `z/(h−z)` too large — 9.3% at track height under a 1 m camera. That
 * bias lands in DPT and so in car width, the drift tolerance, the `min_dpt`
 * gate and the resample factor. `h` removes it in closed form; focal length
 * cannot, because it cancels from the ratio. See `SPEC.md` § Camera height.
 *
 * **A pair still needs one height.** Both points of a pair must share `z`, and
 * that is not a simplification: two points at different heights sit at
 * different depths *and* different azimuths, so their pixel separation is not
 * any scale times any distance — recovering it would need the position model
 * deliberately not built (#135). What the camera height changes is that pairs
 * at *different* heights now combine correctly into one fit, each normalized to
 * layout zero, where before they either blended silently (a latent ~9% error)
 * or one plane's worth was all you could use.
 *
 * **Absent `h` the fit restricts to the reference plane** — "without a camera
 * height I can only speak about the plane you named" — and points off it stay
 * stored but inert. That is the historical behaviour for the single-plane
 * archives that are the only ones in existence, so it changes no number any of
 * them reports. `z` equality is exact: the values are typed by hand.
 *
 * The `d_mm²` weighting favours long baselines automatically, which is the
 * right bias — click error is a fixed number of pixels, so short baselines are
 * proportionally noisier. It matters twice here, because a wrong `h` is only
 * visible through pairs at two heights, and short baselines drown that signal.
 *
 * @returns DPT, or `null` when no usable pair with a nonzero separation exists
 *          — one rule covering the empty, single-point, off-reference-plane and
 *          coincident-point cases — or when the geometry is incoherent
 *          (`h` at or below the reference plane). `null` means "I cannot
