 * How the authored class taxonomy is *read*. The taxonomy itself is authored in
 * `config.yaml` and reaches here through the generated `@occupancy/config`; this
 * module holds only the two rules for interpreting it.
 *
 * It lives in this package rather than in `ui/` because it now has two
 * consumers that must agree: the editor, where a non-conforming class is a
 * visible warning, and the corpus validator, where the same mismatch blocks a
 * submission. A rule implemented twice agrees only until someone edits one
 * copy — and these two matter *most* in the case where they disagree, because a
 * contributor would then be rejected for a class the editor drew as fine.
 *
 * This is not parse-time validation and must not become it: `class` is a plain
 * string at the format layer, deliberately (`SPEC.md` § Format). A format that
 * refused to open files because someone pruned `config.yaml` would punish
 * config edits.
