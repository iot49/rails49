 * These live in the validator rather than in the workflow so that a path
 * violation lands in the same report as everything else: the summary table is a
 * rendering of that report, and a class of failure emitted somewhere else would
 * be a class of failure the table silently omits. They are also covered by
 * `pnpm test`, which a workflow's YAML never is.
 *
 * Nothing here knows about GitHub. The PR author's handle arrives as a
 * parameter — GitHub-specific *data*, not GitHub-specific *logic*.
