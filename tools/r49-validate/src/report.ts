/**
 * The one shape both surfaces read.
 *
 * A corpus PR is reported in two places — `::warning` annotations attached to
 * the archive's path, and a table on the run's job summary — and they must
 * never disagree about what was found. So the validator produces this, and the
 * workflow renders it twice. Nothing about GitHub appears below: the tool
 * decides what is true, the workflow decides how it is displayed.
 *
 * Blocking errors and warnings are separate fields rather than one list with a
 * severity, because the distinction is the whole point of the soft bar and a
 * consumer must not have to filter correctly to respect it.
