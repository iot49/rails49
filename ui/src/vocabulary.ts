 * The authored class taxonomy, read as a tree — the one place `ui/` learns what

 *
 * A pure module for the same reason `geometry.ts` is one: it is arithmetic over
 * data, and a component cannot be tested in jsdom. Everything here is derived
 * from `detector.vocabulary` in `config.yaml`, reached through the generated
 * `@occupancy/config`, so **adding a subtype there and regenerating changes the
 * editor's menu with no code edit** — and no class name is written anywhere
 * else in `ui/` (`SPEC.md` § Parameters live in `config.yaml`).
 *
 * Two rules the tree is read with, both of which are wrong somewhere if
 * reimplemented:
 *
 * * **A nested object is a subtype; anything else is a property.** `width_mm`
 *   is an optional per-class width override that sits beside subtypes in the
 *   same mapping, and telling the two apart structurally is what avoids a
 *   reserved list of key names that config.yaml would then have to know about.
 * * **The stored class is always rooted, and the root is never shown.** A label
 *   maps to the longest entry of `detector.classes` that is a segment-prefix of
 *   its class, so an unrooted `loco.steam` matches nothing and is **dropped
 *   from the export** — the unlabeled-car-as-background failure the
 *   completeness rule exists to prevent. So `class` carries `stock.` and the
 *   menu renders the root's children.
