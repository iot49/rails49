/**
 * Sensor rendering for SVG: a ringed diamond labelled with its name, or with
 * its id when it has none.
 *
 * A module rather than a custom element, like `marker.ts` and
 * `calibrationMarker.ts` — custom elements break the SVG namespace when nested
 * inside `<svg>`. `sensorMarkerStyles` and `renderSensor` **must be used
 * together**: the styles in the host's `static styles`, the renderer once per
 * sensor. `sensorLabelText` is separable — it answers what a sensor is called,
 * which a consumer may want without drawing anything.
 *
 * **The symbol is deliberately unlike the calibration crosshair** in shape and
 * in colour: `SPEC.md` § Reference points requires calibration points to be
 * placed with a tool distinct from the sensor tool and to be visually
 * unmistakable from one. A crosshair is two crossing arms in cyan; a sensor is a
 * closed amber diamond, so the two are told apart at a glance and by shape alone
 * on a photograph that happens to be cyan or amber.
 *
 * The diamond is also honest about what a sensor *is*: a single query point
 * (`SPEC.md` § Location Data), so the symbol closes around the pixel it names
 * rather than extending arms that could be read as an extent.

  /* L1, as colour on the symbol the sensor already is (#85). **Shape carries

     like one at exactly the moment it is being watched. Only the ink literal
     moves, so the diamond, its core and its label recolour together, the same
     one-override mechanism .car.unknown-class uses.

     Red for occupied and green for clear rather than the reverse: this mirrors
     prototype signalling and the deliberate bias of SPEC.md § The vocabulary,
     where a failure shows occupied. Grey for unknown because it is the
     absence of an answer — "I was unable to look" — and a third saturated
     colour would read as a third measurement. An **unstated** state keeps the
     authored amber: that is the editor, where a sensor is a thing being placed
