/**
 * Undo/redo for the editor, as scoped snapshots of the manifest.
 *
 * A plain module, not an element: `rr-app` owns one instance and passes it down
 * (see `ui/README.md` § State and data flow). It deliberately does **not** live
 * in `@occupancy/r49` — that package is a parser/serializer, and an edit history
 * is an editing-session concept, coupled here to view state that means nothing
 * to the training exporter or to `fixtures.test.ts`.
 *
 * Three properties are load-bearing, and each one closes a failure mode:
 *
 * 1. **Snapshots, not inverse commands.** Every entry carries `before` and
 *    `after` clones of the subtree it touched, so undo and redo are one
 *    operation with the fields swapped. There is no per-command inverse to
 *    author, and therefore no way to write one that silently produces a subtly
 *    wrong manifest — the failure that would surface a training run later.
 * 2. **Scoped, not whole-manifest.** Every edit targets exactly one image
 *    record, the layout, or the images array, so an entry costs kilobytes
 *    rather than the hundreds of KB a fully labeled manifest runs to. The
 *    corollary the editor must honour: **key on label `id`, never on object
 *    identity** — applying a snapshot replaces the objects wholesale.
 * 3. **No holes.** A history that silently skips some edits is worse than none,
 *    because the binding teaches the user to trust it. Deleting an image
 *    therefore retains its bytes rather than being excluded as too expensive.
 *
 * @see SPEC.md § Undo and redo
