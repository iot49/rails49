/**
 * Opening a detector session, in one place.
 *
 * Two views need one now — the live view runs it per camera frame, and the
 * diagnostics view runs it over an archive's stills (#87) — and the setup
 * around `loadDetector` is not incidental: it points ORT at the runtime this
 * app serves, and it is the only place that knows the app's base path. Written
 * twice, the second copy is the one that silently 404s under a changed `base`,
 * which is exactly the failure `modelAssets.ts` exists to prevent for the model
 * filename.
 *
 * **The `onnxruntime-web/wasm` specifier is the load-bearing detail.** It must
 * match `lib/detector/src/browser.ts` character for character: two specifiers
 * are two module instances, and the `ort.env.wasm` configured here would not be
 * the one the detector's session reads. Putting the import in one file rather
 * than two is the point — see `ui/CLAUDE.md` § Model loading.

 * does about a failure differs — the live view keeps its loop running and
 * reports every sensor `unknown`, the diagnostics view has nothing to report at
 * all and says so. Deciding that here would take the choice away from both.
 *
 * Each caller owns the session it opens and must `dispose()` it. Two views are
 * never mounted at once, so nothing is shared and nothing is reference-counted:
 * a cache would have to outlive the view that opened it, and the failure mode
 * is a WASM heap held for a session nobody is using.
