/**
 * Opening a drift check against an archive, in one place.
 *
 * Two surfaces need one — the live view refuses to classify on it (#94) and the
 * editor warns on it (#95) — and everything platform-specific about getting
 * there lives here rather than in either. `@occupancy/drift` takes a
 * `GrayPlane`, deliberately: `ImageData` does not exist in Node and the
 * benchmark is a first-class consumer, so somebody has to hold the canvas, and
 * this is the `detectorSession.ts` of the drift path.
 *
 * **The reference is decoded at its native resolution and that is load-bearing.**
 * `DriftResult.displacementPx` is reported in the reference's frame, so handing
 * the check a pre-shrunk image would silently rescale every number — and the
 * tolerance `maxDriftPx` derives is in `camera.resolution` pixels. The check
 * clamps to its own working resolution internally; letting it do that is what
 * keeps the number meaning one thing.

 * surfaces need the number — the live view refuses on it and prints it, the
 * editor warns on it — and written twice it is the `carWidthPx` mistake again: a
 * constant that biases a safety decision, living in two files with nothing
 * checking that they agree.
 *
 * DPT *is* pixels per track gauge, so this is a fraction of a track width
 * expressed in the frame the sensors were authored in. That is the frame the
 * failure happens in: occupancy breaks when a sensor stops sitting on the car it
 * reads, which is a geometric condition, not a pixel count — the same physical
 * misalignment matters equally at DPT 18 and at DPT 90.

 *            an uncalibrated layout has no track width to take a fraction of,

 * camera and kept anyway (the editor warns, it never blocks) joined the
 * reference set, so the drifted pose then scored ~0 and the refusal never fired

 * user cannot see — the oldest filename, say — would be safer against accident
 * and much harder to understand or correct.
 *
 * Returns `null` for an archive with no decodable first image, which is a real
