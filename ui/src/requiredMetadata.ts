 * The layout metadata an archive must carry before it can be authored, and the
 * one place the list is declared.
 *
 * Decided on [#139](https://github.com/rails49/occupancy/issues/139). `SPEC.md`
 * § Camera height carries the reasoning; the short version is that
 * `camera_height_mm` costs one tape measurement per layout, cannot be
 * recovered later once the camera has moved, and is the difference between
 * archives whose DPT is comparable across contributors and archives whose DPT
 * is up to ~9% apart depending on which plane someone happened to calibrate on.
 *
 * **Enforcement is here and not in the schema.** A required *field* would fail
 * every archive that predates it — the orphan-everything cost of a version bump
 * arriving by another road. A required *dialog* migrates an archive on its
 * first edit and orphans nothing, which is the `.optional()`-plus-a-gate shape
 * `@occupancy/r49` was given.
 *
 * Adding a requirement is one entry in {@link missingLayoutMetadata}.

 * `scale` is deliberately absent: the schema requires it, so it is never
 * missing. A new archive is created with a placeholder, and the gate still
 * shows the dialog then — because a new archive has no camera height — which is
 * where a wrong scale gets seen and corrected. There is no representable
 * difference between "scale the user confirmed" and "scale the app invented",
 * and inventing one (a `scale_confirmed` flag) would be a field the format does
 * not need.
