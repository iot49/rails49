/**
 * Calibration-point rendering for SVG: a crosshair labelled with its world
 * coordinate.
 *
 * A module rather than a custom element for the same reason `marker.ts` is —
 * custom elements break the SVG namespace when nested inside `<svg>`. Its two
 * exports **must be used together**: `calibrationMarkerStyles` in the host's
 * `static styles`, the renderer once per point.
 *
 * Why a crosshair and not another symbol from `marker.ts`: a calibration point
 * must be visually unmistakable from everything else the editor draws
 * (`SPEC.md` § Reference points), and the sensor tool that arrives next needs a
 * symbol that cannot be confused with this one. A crosshair also shows the
 * *exact* pixel it names, which a boxed icon does not.

 *   handle a gesture has on one, and it is rendered as `data-calibration-index`
 *   for tests and for debugging.
 * @param size Symbol size in **image pixels**, which the viewer recomputes from
 *   the viewport so the crosshair stays a constant size on screen.
 * @param frame The image's bounds, `rr-viewer`'s `resolution`. Only the label
 *   reads it, to flip inwards at an edge instead of being clipped; the
 *   crosshair is drawn on its pixel wherever that pixel is.
 * @param highlighted Whether a reveal is pointing at this point (#37) — the
