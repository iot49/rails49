 * Car rendering for SVG: the chord between the two clicked ends, the
 * translucent width rectangle derived from DPT, and a handle at each end.
 *
 * A module rather than a custom element, like `calibrationMarker.ts` and
 * `sensorMarker.ts` — custom elements break the SVG namespace when nested
 * inside `<svg>`. Its exports **must be used together**: `carMarkerStyles` in
 * the host's `static styles`, `renderCar` once per label, `renderCoupler` once
 * per coupling, `renderPendingCar` for the chain in flight and
 * `renderDetection` once per L0 box.
 *
 * **A detection lives here too, and that is deliberate** (#85). It is the same
 * object seen from the other side — a car the model predicted rather than one a
 * human authored — so it shares the ink, the label styling and the winding
 * rule, and the two can be drawn in one picture and compared by eye. Giving it
 * its own module would mean a second copy of the magenta literal, which is the
 * same mistake the car width made before `carWidthPx` had one home.
 *
 * **The rectangle is the reason the car tool is gated on calibration.** A car
 * is two free clicks on the visible ends (`SPEC.md` § Authoring cars), and
 * nothing about those two clicks says whether the label actually covers the
 * car — the width does, and the width is *derived* from DPT rather than stored
 * (2.09 track widths, in every scale). Drawing it is therefore not decoration:
 * it is the only feedback the labeler gets.
 *
 * Magenta, against the calibration crosshair's cyan and the sensor diamond's
 * amber. The three objects are authored by three tools and mean three different
 * things, so `SPEC.md` § Reference points' requirement that they be
 * unmistakable extends to this one — and the colour is picked to be rare in a
 * photograph of a layout, where green foliage and amber ballast are not.
 */

/**
 * The two custom properties a detection's ink override sets, or `''` for none.
 *
 * Both or neither: an override that moved only `--car-ink` would leave the
 * wash off, and one that moved only the wash would put a coloured fill inside
 * a pink outline. They are written here rather than at the call site so the
 * pairing cannot come apart — the same reason every module in this directory
 * exports its renderer and its styles together.
