 * Two files have to agree about this and they run in different worlds: the
 * static-copy target in `vite.config.ts`, which puts the file in the bundle at
 * build time, and the `loadDetector` call in `src/rr-live-view.ts`, which
 * fetches it at run time. They used to be two string literals, and a rename
 * that touched one of them produced a 404 at the moment the camera came up —
 * the one place a build cannot check and a typecheck cannot see. So the URL is
 * derived from the filename rather than written beside it.
 *
 * The detector is the **only** model in the bundle. The CNN is retained and
 * retrainable (`SPEC.md` § Option 2) but nothing loads it: L1 is a pure
 * function of L0, so the per-sensor answer is a geometric consequence of the
 * detector's boxes and there is nothing left for a second model to say. One
 * model, one ORT session, one vocabulary — settled in issue #7.
 *
 * `tests/modelAssets.test.ts` holds the chain to these values.
