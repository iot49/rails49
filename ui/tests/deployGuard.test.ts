// Why the deploy directory needs a guard that checks for *absence* is in
// `bin/check-deploy-dir.sh`'s header and in CLAUDE.md § Deploy (#122); the
// short version is that every earlier check was one-directional and none could
// see 21 MB of corpus archives in the bundle. `ui/tests/publicDir.test.ts`
// closed the source they came in through. This covers the deploy directory
// itself.
//
// What is specific to this file: the inventory lives in the shell script, not
// here. These tests *run* that script against directories they construct, so
// there is no second copy to drift — the thing under test is the thing the
// deploy runs. That is the reason the guard is its own script rather than a
// block inside `bin/deploy.sh`, which cannot be exercised without a build, a
// 1Password lookup and an upload.
