// `ui/public` is the one directory vite copies into `dist/` verbatim, with no
// manifest of what it holds and no transform on the way — and `bin/deploy.sh`
// rsyncs `dist/` to production. Everything else in the bundle is named
// somewhere: `ortAssets.ts` names the runtime, `modelAssets.ts` names the
// model, and a test holds each of them to it. `public/` is named by nothing,
// so what ships from it is whatever happens to be sitting there.
//
// That is how a symlink to a 21 MB corpus checkout came to be published
// (#122). Gitignoring it (#108) stopped git from carrying it and did nothing
// about the build, because the build reads the working tree — so the guard has
// to read the working tree too.
