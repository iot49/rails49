# *present*, no single file may exceed Cloudflare's per-file limit — and none of
# them could see 21 MB of corpus archives sitting in the bundle: six files,
# individually small, with an ordinary extension, reached through a symlink the

# Its own script rather than a block inside `bin/deploy.sh` so that it can be
# run against a directory built for the purpose. `ui/tests/deployGuard.test.ts`
# does exactly that — it constructs deploy directories and runs *this* file, so
# the inventory below has no second copy anywhere to drift from.

# `pipefail` is not decoration: the total-size check reads the bundle through a

# 0 — the gate would pass on an understated total. Measured: a 200 KB file made
# unreadable took 200 KB off the reported size and nothing said a word. Every
# other check here fails closed; that one would have failed open.

# --- The inventory -----------------------------------------------------------
#
# One level, and that is not a weakening of the two this had when the app was
# staged under `ui/` (rails49/control#47). Those two levels were the staging
# root and the build output's top level; the build output is now the deploy
# directory itself, so this one list names exactly the set the two used to. #122
# landed on that level — the archives appeared at `proto-fixtures/`, inside the
# subtree the build legitimately writes — and it is still the level checked.
#
# A list rather than a rule, following `ui/tests/publicDir.test.ts` and
# `ui/tests/modelAssets.test.ts`. Every cheaper rule has to guess which content
# counts, and what shipped was ordinary by every cheap measure. Membership, not
# equality: `ui/models/` is absent on a clone with no local detector, and the
# app ships a no-model banner instead (#85).
#
# One level is where it stops, and that is a real limit rather than an
# oversight: `shoelace/assets/icons/` is 2000 files two levels down, so a deeper
# inventory would have to enumerate a vendored tree. Payload buried under a name
# and extension the list allows is left to the size budget, which is why the
# budget is part of this and not a nicety.

# Everything the deploy directory may hold. `assets` is vite's hashed output,
# `ort` and `shoelace` and `models` are `viteStaticCopy` targets named in
# `ui/ortAssets.ts` and `ui/modelAssets.ts`, and `_headers` and the two SVGs are
# all of `ui/public/`, which vite copies to the root verbatim.
ROOT_ENTRIES="_headers index.html assets ort shoelace models favicon.svg icons.svg"

# Extensions that never belong in a web bundle. Redundant with the inventory
# above by design — each names a real directory in this repo or beside it that
# somebody could copy or link in, and this half of the guard still fires when
# the content arrives somewhere the inventory does not reach.

# The bundle measured 18.0 MiB over 2061 files on the day this was written:
# 12.4 MiB of ORT runtime, 3.4 MiB of INT8 detector, 1.5 MiB of shoelace icons,
# 0.6 MiB of app, 0.02 MiB of markup and SVGs. 24 MiB leaves a third again in
# headroom — enough for a detector retrained at a larger size, and well below
# the 38.7 MiB the bundle measured with the fixtures in it. Raise it
# deliberately, with a reason: the number is only worth having while it still
# means something.
#
# (Those are apparent bytes. The same tree is 25 MB by `du`, which is block
# size — 2000-odd shoelace icons of a few hundred bytes each rounding up to a
# 4 KiB block. Measure this one the way the check below does, or the budget
# ends up justified by a number 40% too big.)
